                                There more visual freedom in parallax website design. Rather than focusingon block style information architecture, you can create refreshing and engaging visuals such as animations or beatiful photography, that act as a continum,ultimately inspiring users
                                to scroll further down the page.

                            mobiles and tablets have evolved the way we engage in websites. it's now less about clicking and more about scrolling, swiping and tapping. long crolling websites take away the barrier of complex navigation, providing a resposive, user friendly experience
                            for mobile users.

                            these days, scrolling is so simple that it's become an instinctive action, whereas clicking through to another page requires though and motivation. a single page website allows user to identify their purpose on the website quicker, than needing to sift
                            through multiple pages.

                            One of the biggest problems that parallax websites face is that they are not SEO friendly. why? when you limit the number of pages on you website,google has fewer pages to index and negatively impacts your standing on the search engine results page (SERP).
                            luckily there are ways around this

                                50% of website users bounce off the page if it hasn't loaded in 3-5 seconds. so the more high resolution imagery and animations you include, the longer it takes to load the page. when writing this article, we tested some popular websites, and found that
                                the ones with complex visuals took up to 30 seconds to load on a mobile device, whereas simple and minimalist long-scroll websites loaded within a few seconds.

                            instead of hitting the "back" button, users must scroll back up the page which can be frustrating for users who want to refer back to a certain element. an easy way around this is to include top navigation and have each element anchored to a category
                            or section.
